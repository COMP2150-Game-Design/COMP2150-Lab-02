# Week 2 - Iteration, Greyboxing and Playtesting
Today we will be getting familiar with the use of iterative design in our game making process. By the end of today's class, you'll have some experience asking design questions about your game, and iterating on feedback from playtesters.

## Tools used
Today's task uses (but is not limited to):

* Github Desktop (or your Github client of choice)
* Unity

## Assignment deliverable
There is no direct assignment deliverable today. However, your iteration on your scene from last week will help you get a better grip on how to think about designing your level for particular experiences, and expose you to the process of playtesting. These skills will be necessary for the Level Design Task.

## Retrieving your project from last week (10 min)
Instead of creating a new scene today, you'll be iterating on what you built last week. If you have not created any sort of level from last week, spend some time doing so now. You may even want to revisit last week's sheet for some ideas.

Once you've got the project ready to go, play through it once or twice. Seeing it with fresh eyes, are you noticing any problems with it? Consider some big-picture design quality questions:

* Does the player know where they are going?


### Reflect
Include a section on reflection to ensure students are doing something with their knowledge in the moment.

## Next Week
